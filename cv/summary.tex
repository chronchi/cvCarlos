Mathematician doing a PhD in molecular life sciences at EPFL in Switzerland. 
Developed machine learning algorithms for biomarker discovery with transcriptomics
data in breast cancer. 
Experienced in transcriptomic analysis, including bulk RNA-seq, microarray
and single-cell RNA-seq. Generated reports and pipelines using
reproducible standards, such as quarto markdown and docker. 
Learned and implemented biostatistical
pipelines to analyse growth measurements data. Love to communicate and
perform interdisciplinary work.

Worked with deep learning and artificial intelligence in problems related
to protein stability and computer vision.
Besides the mentioned interests, huge fan of sports, specially table tennis and soccer.
Always thinking what is the best approach to solve a problem.
