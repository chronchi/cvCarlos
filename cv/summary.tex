Mathematician doing a PhD in molecular life sciences in a breast cancer lab at the
Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. 
Developed \textbf{statistical algorithms} for \textbf{biomarker} discovery with
transcriptomics data in breast cancer. 
Experienced in \textbf{transcriptomic analysis}, including single cell and bulk RNA-seq
and microarray. I am dedicated and detail oriented, 
using recent tools for reports and pipelines using
reproducible standards, such as \textbf{quarto} markdown, \textbf{docker} and \textbf{shiny apps}. 
Developed novel \textbf{biostatistical algorithms} and
pipelines to analyse growth measurement data from in vivo and 
high-throughput experiments using \textbf{bayesian inference}. Experienced 
in \textbf{communicating} with bioscientists regarding their projects
and helping them tackling their questions.
Previously worked with \textbf{deep learning} and \textbf{artificial intelligence} in problems related
to protein stability and computer vision.
